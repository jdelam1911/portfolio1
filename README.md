# Mock Portfolio!!

## Description
A begginer portfolio to test my CSS and html skills

## Use

This repo has allowed me to be able to present a well made, in my opinion, begginer portfolio. Granted it is a mock version it is also a preview to what I am capable of here in the future to excel my skills and knowledge with items such as transitions, borderering boxes, sliding effect, etc!
